## -McKinsey-Big-Data-Hackathon_PYTHON

McKinsey Big Data Hackathon_PYTHON models are built on Python Language. 
 
 
Earlier we build the model in R Studio [click here](https://github.com/RutvijBhutaiya/McKinsey-Big-Data-Hackathon) and for this project we build the models in Python. However, the datasets are the same. 

In this project we also performed random Forest supervised ML model.
